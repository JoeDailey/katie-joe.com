              Our love story began in the summer of 2018 when Katie, a
              bright-eyed intern, joined Joe's team. There turned out to be more
              than just workplace synergy between them. After Katie's returned
              to college and later moved to San Francisco for work, it seemed
              like they might never reconnect. But in 2020, Katie made the bold
              move to Seattle to be with Joe. Since then, they’ve travelled the
              world, gotten a puppy, and moved to Houston. Now, they’re excited
              to start the next chapter of their lives together!

        <p>
          Please attend wearing cocktail attire. Bright and patterned styles are
          encoraged. Men should wear a suit or dress shirt. Women should wear a
          cocktail dress or dressy seperates. We recommend a jacket for the
          evenings this time of year.
        </p>
        <h1>Accomodations</h1>
        <p>
          We have 2 room blocks available for our guests. One is near the venue
          in beautiful sea-side La Jolla. The second is in downtown San Diego
          (25 minutes by car) for those who are looking to spend more time in
          the city proper.
        </p>
        <h2>The Empress</h2>
        <p>
          The Empress is walking distance to the venue and La Jolla's downtown
          and cove. Follow

          and book before April 16th for the group rate. Please note that if you
          want to extend your stay beyond the 16th and 17th, with the group
          rate, you can book two nights and then call to extend your stay.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Westin is in downtown San Diego, which is 25 minutes from La

        <h1>Travel Recommendations</h1>
        <p>
          The closest airport is San Diego International Airport (SAN) about 14
          miles from the venue. LAX is the next closest large airport, but is 2
          hours away by car. Traffic between L.A. and San Diego is notoriously
          heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For transportation during your stay, we recommend Uber/Lyft or renting
          a car. However, the venue has extremely limited street parking, so
          whichever option you choose, we recommend that you Uber/Lyft or walk
          to the event itself.
        </p>
        <h1>Registry</h1>
        <p>
          In place of a traditional gift registry, we would be honored to
          receive red envelopes. These are known as “红包“ (“hong bao”) in
          Chinese culture. These envelopes, which typically contain money, are a
          meaningful tradition that symbolize good fortune. If you don't want to
          bring cash with you or still want to give a gift, we have
          <a href="https://venmo.com/u/Joe-Dailey-1" target="_blank">Venmo</a>.

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>Can I bring my children?</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate children unless explicitly listed
          on your invitations. We hope that you will understand this decision
          and that you will still be able to join us on our special day.
        </p>
        <h2>What time should I arrive?</h2>
        <p>
          The ceremony is at 4pm. Please give yourself time to park and find the
          ceremony site. Traffic can be difficult in the San Diego.
        </p>
        <h2>Is there Parking?</h2>
        <p>
          There is limited street parking at the venue. We encourage you to take
          a cab or walk if possible.
        </p>
        <h2>What will the weather be like?</h2>
